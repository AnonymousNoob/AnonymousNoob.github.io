		<div class="lang">
		<h2>C++</h2>
			<div class="lang_desc">
				This was the first language I ever learnt . There's something about C and C++ that makes it more fun to code with . However I was a noob then (used turbo for quite a long time :/) . I always loved using the gotoxy() and the getchar() function , it made the output more visually appreciable .

<div class="section" id="section1">
		<div class="lang">
		<h2>Java</h2>
			<div class="lang_desc">
				This was the first language I felt proud of learning . When all my friends would use <i>gcc</i> and talk trash about how java was so poorly structured for programmers , I'd always enjoy coding in java . I was comfortable enough with it and made my first GUI with it !. I love using the Collections and the util package . It's indeed a very vast language but has everything you want . Running your own terminals , your own <i>Robot</i> and more . I always tended to use the built-in methods . This was when I started focusing more on the time/space complexities . Always tried to come up with a better algo and shrink my program.

<div class="section" id="section2">
		<div class="lang">
		<h2>Python</h2>
			<div class="lang_desc">
				After java I never wrote programs that exceeded 100s of lines . I thought that was the milestone . But there I was going through the docs of a language that existed since I was born (didn't know about it until then :( ) . I was genuinely mind blown by the fact that this was developed on top of the most reliable language out there and still made sense to any newbie who read the code .<i> It was simple ! </i>. As much as I expected such a simple language to be less secure/efficient , it took me by awe . This was when I started using the term <i>module</i> more than anything . To see such a community that was strong and made cool stuff made things even better .  All those modules and frameworks out there have helped me implement the ideas I had on mind . I love using <i>BeautifulSoup</i> , <i>MechanicalSoup</i> and <i>Mechanize</i> for Scrapping and <i>Django</i> for Web Development . I've played around this language for quite a while and used around 100 different awesome modules . You can even build GUI with this (Tkinter for starters) !.

		<h2>Html</h2>
			<div class="lang_desc">
				Html ! . Having established that I'm a WebDev there's got to be an interesting story behind learning Html. In fact this quite might be interesting . In all reality , I never properly learned Html . Neither did I sit with the docs nor did I go through any tuts . I used Photoshop to design Web Pages and of course never cared what it generated except for what was displayed on the Browser . This was getting too old , so I started looking into the folders that Photoshop rendered my web pages . That's when I discovered the <i>index.html</i> file . Didn't quite understand what was going in there for a while and never meddled with it . It was only until I had a serious task to do which indeed required me to edit some html files . I worked my way up with it by just changing things in the file and refreshing the browser . <i>It was wonderful ! </i>. This by far was the best thing that happened to me - I found a way to make money . Though there are lots of tools and frameworks out there , nothing quite works until you associate it with html (or haml or yaml or xml mostly html) . <i>Like a boss !</i> .

		<h2>CSS</h2>
			<div class="lang_desc">
				Like games advanced from working natively on CPUs to GPUs to combination of both , rendering photo realistic images , the way I pictured a web page in my mind totally changed after CSS . I never saw the necessity to design a web page with a tool rather used codes . I had more freedom that way , could do everything just the way I wanted . CSS opened up lots of opportunities . I always liked graphics and always stressed out on making things look better on a browser and not just the way it were . This is what CSS meant to me. According to me CSS is where you express your creativity . No two web developers have the same idea in their minds . And with CSS you can make your work look better than others . Though you have a better idea unless it looks attractive you aren't gonna make it in this game - Web Development .

		<h2>JS</h2>
			<div class="lang_desc">
				So just when I thought I found my fortune cookie (CSS) , there was something more comprehensive and extensive and did a better job making everything on a page look cooler and the basic work flow itself . Having learnt java , initially I had the misconception that javascript was a descendant of java but for web Development (yes it is stupid :/) . But I started playing around with it and was so comfortable handling every event that went through the web site as such . To start with I used JS mostly for optimising web sites for mobile and animations . I then discovered this awesome framework <i>Bootstrap</i> , made things a lot easier . I then went on to explore a couple more frameworks such as <i>Materialize</i> , <i>Angular</i> etc . The thing I love the most about Java Script is it's ease of use and has something for every developer from a beginner to expert to god-like !.

		<div class="lang">
		<h2>jQuery</h2>
			<div class="lang_desc">
				Now that I wondered how I didn't learn something incredible earlier I stumbled upon this piece of art . Of course I learnt most of the tricks from the jQueryUI . But there were just a lot of things  as a Developer that made sense . There's always a better way to do things with jQuery . One of my fondest UI Library till date .

		</div>
</div>

<div class="section" id="section7">
		<div class="lang">
		<h2>PHP</h2>
			<div class="lang_desc">
				Having learnt JS I could possibly find a way to anything I wanted on a Web Page . However I quite didn't like the use of sessions and cookies and databases with JS . That's why I went for PHP . It's been there for a long time now and lots of enterprises prefer this robust artwork . It was more flexible and changed the way I used my html . I no longer had to use Scripts rather my php page would conclude everything under one roof and still abstract all those I didn't want to show on the freaking inspect elements tab . <i>More Abstraction - Less dumber you look to other coders </i> .

</div>

<div class="section" id="section8">
		<div class="lang">
		<h2>Git</h2>
			<div class="lang_desc">
				This is no wonder in any developer &#47; coder &#47; programmer's portfolio . <i>You need this</i> . Not just for version control but I felt more secure using this as a storage and not having to rely on my machine everytime . If I just wanted to edit some of my codes at someplace I didn't carry my laptop or in case my laptop fried I still had backup . But of course Git is one tool/interface I love the most .It's so efficient in forming up a community and letting the world see your work and still be secure enough to not worry about someone else modifying stuff up unnecessarily . And when you find something awesome on GitHub just clone that repo and work on it like you know what everything in there meant (I sucked so bad trying to add somethings to <i>fuchsia</i>) . However I try to contribute to <i>Express Js</i> and it's low-key good . <i>Talk about Open Source ! </i>.

<div class="section" id="section9">
		<div class="lang">
		<h2>hacklang</h2>
			<div class="lang_desc">
				Ever since I heard about <i>Facebook</i>'s Hacklang I was so into it and it sounds cool <i>hacklang</i> . I still am figuring out lots of things in hacklang but I quite have a hang of it now that I've worked on it for a couple of weeks . However there's only one language i hate (C#) and it looks more or less like it (<i>y u do this facebook? php still sux!!</i>) .
			</div>
		</div>
</div>

<div class="section" id="section10">
		<div class="lang">
		<h2>Angular</h2>
			<div class="lang_desc">
				Angular is one of my favourite frameworks today . Though working with js nowadays suck , like <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dMTIh1eSnmI"><i>Chris Hawkes</i></a> and (Simple Programmer) <a href="http://simpleprogrammer.com/2013/05/06/why-javascript-is-doomed/"><i>Jon Sonmez</i></a> talk about this on one of their YouTube videos there's always flaws with one framework that the other fixes and the new one causes other new problems and so on , Angular is a more well structured and properly constructed tool . I started working with Angular so that I had Dynamics inhibited in my web pages . I try to keep up with the updates as much as I can and have found many things interesting in the 2.0 version of Angular.

<div class="section" id="section11">
		<div class="lang">
		<h2>Django</h2>
			<div class="lang_desc">
				Like I said before , Python is the best language for lazy programmers like me . And Django does exactly the same with Web Development . Creating an Admin interface was never difficult after Django . It has such an excellent architecture and the strength of this tool is magnificent . I spend most of my time working on Django and I love this tool the most out of all . It's more organized and not too shaby and Jinja does a better job than many of the template engines out there . Being a MVT framework it does a great job in reducing the unnecessary tasks that a developer has to do. But the most interesting part of Django is usability of all python modules in django . However I miss using <i>Mechanize</i> inside Django (they stopped support for py &lt; 3.0 :/) .
